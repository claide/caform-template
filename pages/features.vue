            Allows organizations to set predefined spending limits for various

            This process helps companies manage their finances, prevent

          <p class="mb-4 text-[#767676]">
            Cost categories and partners are key features that organizations use
            to manage their expenses more effectively. Cost categories provide a
            way to group expenses into different categories, making it easier to
            track and analyze spending patterns.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[#767676]">
            Partner integration, on the other hand, simplifies the invoicing and
            payment processes, reducing the time and effort needed to manage
            accounts payable. These features help companies gain better
            visibility and control over their finances, enabling them to make
            more informed business decisions and achieve their financial goals.
